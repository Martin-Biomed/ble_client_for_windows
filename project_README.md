### Installing Requirements (pip)
The requirements needed to run this project were automatically generated by using pipreqs.
The following process was used to generate the list of required Python dependencies.

1. In the base project dir, install the package using: **pip install pipreqs**
2. To generate a Python dependencies list, enter cmd: **pipreqs . --ignore ".venv"**
   1. This command generates a "requirements.txt" file with the required dependencies.
3. Install the list of dependencies using: **pip install -r requirements.txt**

If using PyCharm, these dependencies are only installed within the scope of the (venv).
